# Katha video

A pravachan clip turned into an animated story: the characters act out the kahani, the speaker talks from a lip-synced corner badge, and Hindi captions follow every word.

**Input:** a 60–90 second pravachan MP3.
**Run it:** `/katha-video` and attach or name the file.

## Steps

1. If music or noise sits behind the voice, separate the vocals with demucs.
2. Transcribe in Devanagari with whisper (large-v3), then stop and show me the text so I can correct wrong words.
3. Force-align the corrected text and make a mouth-open curve from the voice loudness.
4. Plan 20–26 shots in 6–8 chapters with Hindi titles and show me the shot list before writing any code.
5. Draw the speaker with respect (never comic) on a golden seat with a starry backdrop, plus the story's cast, in a flat Indian cartoon style.
6. Captions in 3–5 word Hindi chunks with the spoken word in a marigold pill, a chapter chip top-left, and a 9:16 version with the speaker below the story.

## Every time it runs

- Draw everything in code (an HTML canvas rendered frame by frame in headless Chrome, encoded with ffmpeg). No stock footage or image generators, so the look is the same every time.
- Time every word with forced alignment (torchaudio MMS_FA). Never guess timings.
- Show me a contact sheet of stills before the full render, and ask before overwriting files.
- Render the MP4 with the original audio, plus a 720p copy under 20 MB for WhatsApp.
