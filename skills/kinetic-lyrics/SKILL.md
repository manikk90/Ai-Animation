# Kinetic lyrics

Big kinetic typography for an English song, like Justin Bieber's “Let Me Love You”: every word punches in on the beat in chunky letters on black, with paint splats and confetti.

**Input:** a song MP3 and its lyrics.
**Run it:** `/kinetic-lyrics` and attach or name the file.

## Steps

1. Separate the vocals, force-align every word, and find the beats with librosa.
2. Black background. Each line builds word by word in heavy rounded display caps; the key word of each line is 2–3× bigger (BELIEVE, BEAUTIFUL, DREAM).
3. Every word lands exactly on its sung time with a pop, a squash and a small shake on strong beats.
4. Add accents that fit the words: falling petals, rain drips on “smoke and mirrors”, a pink paint splat behind “miracle”, sparkles on the chorus.
5. Open with the artist names as a title card, and clear each line with a quick wipe before the next one.
6. Render 16:9 and a 9:16 version.

## Every time it runs

- Draw everything in code (an HTML canvas rendered frame by frame in headless Chrome, encoded with ffmpeg). No stock footage or image generators, so the look is the same every time.
- Time every word with forced alignment (torchaudio MMS_FA). Never guess timings.
- Show me a contact sheet of stills before the full render, and ask before overwriting files.
- Render the MP4 with the original audio, plus a 720p copy under 20 MB for WhatsApp.
